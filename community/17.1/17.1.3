Greetings,

A dozen bug fixes meet several dozen new features and enhancements,
literally!  This update is about making OPNsense more flexible with
the tools that everybody knows: firewall management, DNS services and
Let's Encrypt.

This is also the stepping stone for providing new images based on 17.1
because the Hyper-V disk disappearance was now fixed upstream: a big
thank you to Microsoft and FreeBSD for providing updates!  The vt(4)
console driver migration is still underway, as well as applying
SafeStack for the amd64 architecture and chasing down an IPsec
regression with FreeBSD 11.0.  More on this next time, stay tuned.
