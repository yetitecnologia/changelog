Hi everyone,

The wish list for our kernel improvements has been emptied just a
week ago, which makes 17.1-RC1 look like the final 17.1 for all
intents and purposes and already includes the stable upgrade path.
Several features have been moved from the core to the plugins and
may need to be reinstalled, namely Load Balancer, Wake on LAN, SNMP,
IGMP Proxy and Universal Plug and Play.  More details are listed below.

A special thank you goes to Carlos Meireles and Thiago Basilio, who
brought to you Portuguese as a language choice (Portugal and Brazil,
respectively).  Awesome work!

Direct download links from our capable mirror providers (checksums
below this announcement) are as follows:

https://opnsense.c0urier.net/releases/17.1.r1/ (Europe)

If you have been running 17.1-BETA and want to switch to the stable
upgrade path simply upgrade to 17.1-RC1 and run the following from
the shell:

# # opnsense-update -t opnsense

Here is the full list of changes since 17.1-BETA:

o core: use the sc console driver instead of vt
o core: consolidate anti-lockout behaviour
o core: optionally limit ciphers for web GUI
o core: move individual XMLRPC sync options to their respective services
o core: use rc.shutdown hook for graceful ACPI shutdown
o core: fix locale setting in MVC (contributed by Alexander Shursha)
o core: add translations to the wizard (contributed by Alexander Shursha)
o core: fix several crash reports

o core: configure ddb even if no dump device was found
o core: move bogon rules to fix DHCPv6 WAN scenarios
o web proxy: allow to disable caching by zeroing cache_mem
o plugins: the os-intel-em driver has been removed
o plugins: configuration additions for os-tinc

  os-igmp-proxy, os-wol, os-upnp, os-relayd)

o src: wireless firmware now only available via kernel modules
o src: the EM_MULTIQUEUE kernel option has been removed
o src: HardenedBSD SEGVGUARD improvements
o src: HardenedBSD force -fPIC when building PIEs
o src: do not initialize the adapter on MTU change when ix status is down

o src: restore link state probing for e1000 82574 chipsets
o src: IP cooperative forwarding rework, fixes IPv4 in pf
o src: avoid deadlocks during lagg configuration
o src: multiple fixes for netmap to repair emulation panics

Known issues in this version:

o The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard
  FreeBSD 11.0.  The impact on 6rd setups is currently unknown.
o Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBDS 11.0 could still
  affect operability.
o Insight and Health statistics import from the early installer may not work.
o Due to a Python 2.7.13 incompatibility the NetFlow connector
  may not work.  A workaround is to revert to the Python 2.7.12
  release.  See the forum for details[1].
o The LibreSSL version will not be available until the final release.
o The console settings received a non-backwards compatible change.
  If the VGA console is not working, simply reconfigure it from
  System: Settings: Administration as it was likely set to Serial
  due to a wrong GUI default.

Any help in making 17.1 the best it could possibly be for its final
release January 31 is highly appreciated.  Please do not hesitate to
