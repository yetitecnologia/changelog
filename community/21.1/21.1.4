Hi there,

The third party crypto libraries need patching so here we go!  The number of
user contributions and interaction regarding stability fixes and improvements
from the OPNsense side seems to be picking up as well and that is great to see.

The development version includes an update of Suricata to version 6.0.2
in case any of you want to try it out.  Also, improvements in the DHCP
static mapping can now deal with IPv6 prefix merge for such deployments
using Unbound and Dnsmasq host registration.

In the past 3 months we have also been working on a business edition relaunch
and now feel obligated to quickly present the results of these efforts:

The upcoming release of the business edition will be versioned as 21.4 in
order to decouple it from the community release cycle.  To that end--and
to stay true to open source--we have published the release engineering core
branch for said business release[1].

You will see more distinction between "community" and "business" in
communication, but the basic approach of a more conservative release
cycle in volume and timing for the business edition remains the same.
On top of this, the business edition also offers additional plugins,
e.g. for central management tasks.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add assorted missing configuration sections for high availability sync
