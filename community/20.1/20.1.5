Hi there,

Today ships the first release version of the supplemental firewall rule
API via plugin, a new firewall shaper statistics GUI and API and the usual
number of improvements and third party updates.

Note that this version does not ship OpenSSL 1.1.1g as at this point our
release decision would have been to push 20.1.5 to next week or do a
smaller 20.1.6 next week on top.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: support configuration for SSH HostKeyAlgorithms, KexAlgorithms, Ciphers and MACs
o system: simplify validations in gateway monitor settings
o interfaces: mark VXLAN and loopback devices as configurable
o interfaces: validation typo caused failure to communicate unassignable targets
o interfaces: netstat tree view GUI and API
o interfaces: use libxo to extract ARP data
o firewall: checkbox selection ignores visibility setting
o firewall: add network group type to combine aliases cleanly
o firewall: IPv6 essential icmpv6 allow for ::
o firewall: new shaper statistics GUI and API
o firewall: support filter log messages with PID
o reporting: when flow times are not returned stick to receive timestamp
o openvpn: use multihome when selecting "any" interface with UDP
o unbound: create shared startup script for background task
o mvc: also store "" field value as initial state to prevent empty fields as being marked as changed
o mvc: firewall source NAT ranges support in plugins
o mvc: keep options in static set for PortField
