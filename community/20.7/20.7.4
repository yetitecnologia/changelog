Good evening everyone,

This release finally wraps up the recent Netmap kernel changes and tests.
The Realtek vendor driver was updated as well as third party software cURL,
libxml, OpenSSL, PHP, Suricata, Syslog-ng and Unbound just to name a couple
of them.

We would like to thank Sunny Valley Networks for their relentless efforts
to bring said Netmap fixes and improvements into FreeBSD.

If you are having trouble with a stuck update try the command sequence below
from the root shell or simply reboot from the GUI and rerun the update in
case it was not fully carried out yet.

# pkill syslog-ng
# service syslog-ng restart
