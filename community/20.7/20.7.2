Dear all,

While we are still looking closer at netmap/iflib performance on 12.1 we
are rolling out a kernel with Intel em/igb updates that should avoid bad
packet counts in the default installation.  Syslog-ng received a workaround
for the diagnosed startup issue and alias now supports MAC address content
similar to how host content works.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE in environments
o system: improve parsing for temperature sensors
o system: add "new-password" hint for Chrome on login form
o system: rename syslog services description and hide legacy mode when not enabled
o system: force syslog-ng restart after boot sequence
o system: properly read new style logging directories
o reporting: replace line endings when sending traceback to syslog in flowd_aggregate
o reporting: add traffic graph filter for private IPv4 networks (contributed by kcaj-burr)
o firewall: add MAC address alias type
o firewall: be more verbose when fetching alias remote content
o firewall: prevent pfctl error messages from being suppressed
o firewall: exclude all reserved pf.conf keywords from alias name
o firewall: bogons not loaded on initial load
o firewall: reset damaged bogons files on startup
o interfaces: add listen-queue-sizes in socket diagnostics
o firmware: properly report an unsigned repository
o firmware: revoke 20.1 fingerprint
o intrusion detection: rule cache parse error on invalid metadata
o intrusion detection: allow search for status enabled/disabled
o web proxy: correct template replacement during build time
o web proxy: bugfix in JSON access log
o unbound: updated project block lists links (contributed by gap579137)
o backend: add regex_replace template support
o plugins: os-acme-client 1.36[1]
o plugins: os-dyndns 1.23 adds Gandi LiveDNS support (contributed by vizion8-dan)
o plugins: os-haproxy 2.24[2]
o plugins: os-stunnel 1.0.1 includes performance tweaks
o plugins: os-telegraf 1.8.2[3]
o plugins: os-tinc fixes cipher parsing on 20.7
o src: remove ACPI workaround for serial console on AMD EPYC
o src: Make pf.conf ":0" ignore link-local v6 addresses too
o src: default "show bad packets" tunable to off in e100 driver
o src: fix unsolicited promisc mode in e1000 driver
o src: add valectl to the system commands
o ports: ca_root_nss/nss 3.56[4]
o ports: curl 7.72.0[5]
o ports: libressl 3.1.4[6]
o ports: openldap 2.4.51[7]
o ports: php 7.3.21[8]
o ports: python 3.7.9[9]
o ports: sqlite 3.33.0[10]
o ports: squid 4.13[11]
o ports: syslog-ng dlsym() workaround
o ports: unbound 1.11.0[12]
