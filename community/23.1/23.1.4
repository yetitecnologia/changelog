Good news everyone,

Another stable update to fix a StrongSwan regression and two OpenVPN
incompatibilities introduced prior.  We have also improved the service
handling code in multiple areas, fixed issues like the VIP migration
problem with IP alias on a CARP VIP and improved/simplified the firmware
settings now that cryptography flavours no longer exist.

Here are the full patch notes:

o interfaces: fix an issue with a batch killbyname() in static ARP case
o interfaces: make sure output buffering is disabled when downloading a packet capture
o interfaces: lock gateway save button while the request is being processed
o interfaces: fix IP alias with VHID validation issue
o dhcp: several plumbing improvements in service handling
o dnsmasq: remove now unused host configuration and refactor
o firmware: responsiveness fix (contributed by kulikov-a)
o firmware: move settings handling to full-fledged model
o firmware: add advanced/help toggles, cancel button, subscription errors
o monit: add permanent include statement for custom configuration files (contributed by codiflow)
o openvpn: add ovpn_status.py script and configd action to fetch connected clients
o openvpn: reintroduce "cipher" keyword for older clients
o openvpn: add missing static-challenge parsing for auth framework introduced in 23.1.3
o unbound: adhere to restart logic during hosts configure and wait for service to start
o unbound: add infra-keep-probing advanced option
o unbound: lowercase domain for case insensitive search in blocklists
o mvc: fix PHP warnings and dance around null/0.0.0 ambiguity in migration code
o plugins: os-api-backup 1.1[1]

o plugins: os-theme-tukan 1.27 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-theme-vicuna 1.45 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o ports: curl 7.88.1[2]
