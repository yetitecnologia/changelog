Howdy,

Two major improvements being shipped today are standalone core DNS
support for Bind and Dnscrypt-Proxy plugins as well as OpenVPN group
firewall alias type.  The latter makes it easier to manage distinct
policies for connected VPN users.  For more details please refer to
the documentation listed below.

The other honorable mention is the netmap work we have been doing
with Zenarmor and Klara on the FreeBSD kernel side which brings
bridge device support as well as a considerable improvement to the
emulated mode where several packet stalls and mbuf leaks have been
identified and subsequently fixed.  This should have an operational
impact on Suricata (IPS mode) and Zenarmor.  The state is much better
now but please do not hesitate to contact us about issues that you
might still be having with netmap-based packet flows as the topic is
a rather complex one.

Orange FR users be aware that your ISP now requires strict VLAN PCP
on all DHCPv4 requests so please now set 'Use VLAN priority' interface
setting for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  The 'Option Modifiers' override
for "vlan-pcp" in DHCPv4 can be removed.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: register DNS service ports for unified use across core and plugins
o system: serialize deferred requests for web GUI restart
o system: relocate API messages to backend log target as they currently end up in captive portal logs

o reporting: translate invalid interface name characters for NetFlow/Netgraph use
