Hello, hello, hello!

It has been a while and judging by the extensive list of changes below
one can easily see why.  The impact footprint of this update, however,
is relatively small.  With this update we are also moving into the
18.7-BETA phase where avid users are invited to flip their release version
from production to development in the firmware GUI settings.

Extensive work has been done for DHCPv6 connectivity by the wonderful
folks of Team Rebellion, e.g. fixing the stale daemon issues that prevented
connectivity after reconfiguration.  OpenVPN was updated to version 2.4.6
and received a substantial server setup rejuventation to allow out of the
box IPv6 usage.  LibreSSL received a bump in order to correctly speed up
AESNI, something that was not working since its update to version 2.6.

Users of the web proxy with IDNA domains must take note that the previous
implementation was removed in favour of a less intrusive approach that
does not require encoding and decoding domain names in the configuration.
All domains are now stored verbatim and are only encoded during web proxy
runtime setup.  Formerly created and thus now wrongly encoded domains need
to be deleted and added back.  We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.
