Hello from Suricon!

As we are experiencing the Suricata community first hand in Amsterdam
we though to release this version a bit earlier than planned.  Included
is the latest Suricata 5.0.0 release in the development version.  That
means later this November we will releasing version 5 to the production
version as we finish up tweaking the integration and maybe pick up 5.0.1
as it becomes available.

LDAP TLS connectivity is now integrated into the system trust store,
which ensures that all required root and intermediate certificates will
be seen by the connection setup when they have been added to the authorities
section.  The same is true for trusting self-signed certificates.  On top
of this, IPsec now supports public key authentication as contributed by
Pascal Mathis.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: hook LDAP TLS support into system-wide trust file
o system: fix dpinger custom parameters not being honoured
o system: fix PHP core loop fail in tunables overview
o system: only allow P12 export if password confirmation matches
o interfaces: change PCAP download to binary file stream
o firewall: store reference to outbound NAT address instead of literal address
o firewall: add log message for scheduled firewall reload
o firmware: tie pkg dependency to core
o ipsec: allow EC keys for certificate-based secrets (contributed by Martin Strigl)
o ipsec: add support for public key authentication (contributed by Pascal Mathis)
o openvpn: server wizard existing CA use and server cert check (contributed by johnaheadley)
o backend: add run mode to pluginctl using JSON-based output
o ui: fix tokenizer reorder on multiple saves, second try
o plugins: os-acme-client 1.27[1]
o plugins: os-bind 1.9[2]
o plugins: os-nginx 1.15[3]
o plugins: os-relayd 2.4 fixes protocol option migration (contributed by Frank Brendel)
o plugins: os-theme-cicada 1.22 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o ports: ca_root_nss 3.47
