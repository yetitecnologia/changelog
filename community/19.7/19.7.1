Dear all,

We do not wish to keep you from enjoying your summer time, but this
is a recommended security update enriched with reliability fixes for the
new 19.7 series.  Of special note are performance improvements as well
as a fix for a longstanding NAT before IPsec limitation.

o system: remove unwanted form action tags
o system: do not include Syslog-ng in rc.freebsd handler

o system: fix Syslog-ng search stats
o firewall: HTML-escape dynamic entries to display aliases
