Hey hey,

As Thursday nears the last preparations for 20.1 are underway.  As a quick
relief here is the End-Of-Life release of the 19.7 series with a tiny number
of updates.

Remember that when 20.1 is available it will take up to a day before we
release the hotfix with the major upgrade path enabled.  Please be patient
as we simply want to ensure that upgrades will not be bumpy affair.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

o firewall: fix a typo in CARP validation
o firmware: revoke 19.1 fingerprint
o ipsec: add configurable dpdaction (contributed by Marcel Menzel)
o mvc: BaseListField ignoring empty selected field
o plugins: os-haproxy 2.20[1]
o plugins: os-mail-backup 1.1[2]
o plugins: os-nrpe 1.0 (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-theme-rebellion 1.8.3 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-vnstat 1.2[3]
o plugins: zabbix4-proxy 1.2[4]

o ports: curl 7.68.0[5]
o ports: isc-dhcp 4.4.2[6]
o ports: urllib3 1.27.7[7]

A hotfix release was issued as 19.7.10_1:
