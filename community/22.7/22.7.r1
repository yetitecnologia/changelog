Hi there,

For more than 7 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3

o firmware: disable crash reporter in development and debug deployments
o ipsec: add "IPv4+6" protocol for mobile phase 1 entries (contributed by vnxme)
o ipsec: mobile property boolean duplication in phase 2
o ipsec: remember phase 1 setting for next action
o ipsec: switch to MVC/API variants of SPD, SAD and connection pages
o openvpn: pinned Diffie-Hellman parameter to RFC 7919 4096 bit key

o mvc: bugfix search and sort issues for searchRecordsetBase()
o mvc: add support for non-persistent (memory) models
o mvc: throw when no mount found in model (contributed by agh1467)
o ui: removed Internet Explorer support

o ui: correct required API for command-info in bootgrid (contributed by agh1467)
o ui: add catch undefined TypeError in SimpleActionButton (contributed by agh1467)
o plugins: os-apcupsd 1.0[2] (contributed by David Berry, Dan Lundqvist and Nicola Pellegrini)
o plugins: os-boot-delay is no longer available[3]
o plugins: os-tayga 1.2[4]
o plugins: os-tor no longer available on LibreSSL due to incompatibilities with newer Tor versions
o plugins: os-web-proxy-useracl is no longer available, no updates since 2017

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.r1_8:

o system: disable RRD and NetFlow shutdown backups by default
o system: render interfaces in convert_config()
o interfaces: fix unable to bring up multiple loopback (contributed Johnny S. Lee)
o interfaces: fix unable to bring up multiple VXLAN
o interfaces: check if int before passing to convert_seconds_to_hms()
o ipsec: small UX tweaks in status page
o mvc: fix rowCount when all is selected in searchRecordsetBase()
o plugins: os-nginx fix for missing DH parameter file
o plugins: os-postfix fix for missing DH parameter file

Known issues and limitations:

o The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.  The only downside may be lower performance on older machines.
o The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.  In practice people who used /var MFS had no benefit over it with software that required persistent storage under /var to operate in the first place.  Periodic configuration file writes to /var are negligible on SSD-based systems.
