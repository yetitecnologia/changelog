Happy new year everyone,

We're back, and we have a lot of neat changes and security updates
for you.  Most notably, the firewall pages received a lot of subtle
tweaks to improve user experience.  Secondly, the firmware pages
gained the plugins management feature.  And last but not least, the
kernel and base upgrade gained better signature support[1] that ties
right into FreeBSD's pkg verification mechanism, how cool is that!

We'd like to use this opportunity to thank four of our regular
contributors who've helped us to advance further than we could have
dreamed.  A big thank you to Manuel Faux, Fabian Franz, Frank Wall
and Andreas Martin!  And no, we do not make these up as we go.  ;)
