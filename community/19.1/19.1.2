@ February 28, 2019

Good evening,

This update is the sum of a few weeks of intense testing and debugging
in areas such as WAN DHCP with very short lease times, Suricata IPS not
working as expected, stacked 6RD setups that have overly long device names
amongst others.

The update may be a bit bumpy this time since the web GUI session directory
will be moved to a safer location.  You will be logged out during the update
and the system will reboot due to the included operating system update.  As
soon as it is back you will be able to log in as usual.

LibreSSL received a major upgrade from 2.7 to 2.8. If you are using LibreSSL
and see any issues please do let us know because it sadly looks like third
party projects such as OpenVPN, Squid, StrongSwan and NTP leave the use of
LibreSSL to the few users who are able to fix the source code builds on their
own and we want to ideally avoid having to patch third party software.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: move session files into their own directory (forces the current sessions to expire)
o system: add validation check for time period for Dpinger (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o system: hide "show certificate info" button of pending CSR (contributed by nhirokinet)
o system: move opnsense-auth to libexec, but keep a symlink in sbin directory
o system: escaping issue in gateway edit page
o system: fix ACL for halt and reboot pages
o firewall: fix alias entry replacement in utility page
o firewall: prevent new alias creation when adding an address
o firewall: capture "nat" traffic like we do for "rdr" in live log
o firewall: escaping issues in schedule edit page
o interfaces: push dhclient and dhcp6c log messages to system log
o interfaces: write all nameservers via dhclient-script in multi WAN scenarios
o interfaces: check for valid alias IP in dhclient-script
o interfaces: 6RD interface naming back to 18.7 to sidestep character limits on stacked setups
o interfaces: avoid reading empty interface configurations
o firmware: bootstrap rework for HTTPS repository URL
o firmware: patch cache and assorted improvements
o firmware: minor update utility cleanups
o firmware: remove compatibility stubs for pre-19.1 version reads
o firmware: show revoked package mirror error in GUI if applicable
