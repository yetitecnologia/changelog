Hi there,

For almost four years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.

Download links, an installation guide[1] and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

o Monit general settings do not save.  A patch exists[12] to remedy this problem: opnsense-patch a2899594
o Issue with IDS migration code creating a spurious crash report.  Patch already done for the final 19.1.
o Quagga plugin has been superseded by FRR plugin.  A binary quagga package has been conserved for the time being.
