Howdy,

An UEFI boot panic scenario was debugged last week with the help of the
community.  This update includes a fix that will allow the ones affected
by this 19.1 issue to upgrade or install (and boot of course) correctly.
We are also including the IPsec VTI support and the latest Suricata 4.1.3
with stability and compatibility fixes.

Due to the severity of the UEFI boot panic 19.1.4 will be the new initial
release for all upgrades from 18.7 within a day or two depending on
additional testing and confirmation.  Last but not least there will be
new images some time next week to put this fully behind us.  Thank you
for your patience and understanding.  :)

Special thanks go to the team of Synacktiv for reporting a packet filter
IPv6 vulnerability for which a patch was included as well.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: remove erroneously translated hostname example (contributed by nhirokinet)
o firewall: fix validation regression in outbound NAT introduced in 19.1.3
o firewall: mock labels for NAT rules in live log as pf does not offer label support
o interfaces: do not background LAGG ifconfig destroy
o installer: revert to use network connection to allow CTRL+C and resume
o ipsec: added Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) support
o unbound: fix nested statistics items read
o mvc: remove old Phalcon volt template workarounds from when scopes were broken
o mvc: fix bug in model relation field values merge
o plugins: os-zabbix4-proxy PSK directory fix (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-telegraf missed invoke of setup.sh
o plugins: os-frr adds validator to OSPF prefix lists (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-dmidecode 1.1 fixes data parsing (contributed by Smart-Soft)
o plugins: os-nginx 1.9[1]
o src: do not pass pf(4) IPv6 fragments with malformed extension headers (reported by Synacktiv)
o src: revert upstream commit "protect the kernel text, data, and BSS" to fix certain UEFI boots
o ports: monit 5.25.3[2]
o ports: ntp 4.2.8p13[3]
o ports: php 7.1.27[4]
o ports: suricata 4.1.3[5]
