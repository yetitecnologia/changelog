Welcome back!

No, we would not say it was easy getting here, but booting into 16.1
for the first time sure is as relieving (and exciting) as it could get
for our project growing beyond what we had ever imagined.  It has been
more than a year since OPNsense first came out.  Back then it was
FreeBSD 10.0.  Not even two months after, 10.1 was introduced along
with the opnsense-update utility.  Today is the day for FreeBSD 10.2,
the latest and greatest release currently available for broader driver
support and stability improvements.

16.1 is nicknamed "Crafty Coyote" in honour of our beloved childhood
TV sessions.  It is the accumulation of 6 months of work, having had
our focus on reengineering the captive portal, native intrusion
prevention, plugin support, and transforming the reporting frontend
into something more modern and flexible just to name a few[1].  Apart
from the recently published security advisories (see patch notes below),
we have included a quick navigation feature which can be activated by
pressing (TAB) followed by search keywords and hitting (ENTER) to go to
the desired page.  Last but not least, a larger batch of improvements
and fixes went into assorted sections of the GUI that certainly help
to get your work done without ending up dazed and confused.

Speaking of clearing things up, there is more...  While Ad, Franco
and a couple of amazing external contributors have been busy writing
and reviewing code, Jos worked in the shadows to bring to you a fully
revised set of project documentation in the form of an online
handbook[2].  More content will follow as we slow down development
speed a bit in order to catch up.  We will have to see how that works
out.  ;)

Another thing we have noticed is that translations are hard!  We have
planned to finish a translation for this iteration, but the sheer
amount of work overwhelmed even the sizeable German translation team.
The German translation is now at 77% percent completed with Japanese,
Chinese and French chasing tails.  If you want to help drop us a line
at project@opnsense.org for details on how to contribute.

All images have been pushed as well, although may take a bit more time
to reach a mirror near you.  You can find the checksums attached at the
end of this announcement.
